# Data Cleaning & Validation Pipeline Projects

This repository contains a set of hands-on exercises and projects focused on **data validation**, **cleaning**, and **preparation** ‚Äî key steps in any data analysis or data science workflow. These tasks illustrate common scenarios involving real-world messy datasets, quality checks, and preparation techniques.

## üîç Projects Included

### 1. Task1 Data Validation
Validates incoming datasets by checking for missing values, data type mismatches, and out-of-range values. Includes logic for flagging anomalies and preparing the data for further analysis.

### 2. Final Work_df and Repair_df Task 2
Performs cleaning and repair operations on two linked datasets (`Work_df` and `Repair_df`) using conditional logic and joins. Covers advanced filtering and cross-data consistency validation.

### 3. DS0103EN-Exercise-From-Understanding-to-Preparation
An end-to-end data project that takes a dataset from exploration to preparation. Covers feature selection, missing value handling, and formatting for modeling or visualization purposes.
